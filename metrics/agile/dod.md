# Definition of Done

Before the job is started, a definition of a completed job is specified, and the team commits to this definition. By using DoD, the __whole team shares the same understanding of when the task is completed__.

DoD often states that no development job is finished until testing is complete or the software is shipped to target systems, in a defined quality.
