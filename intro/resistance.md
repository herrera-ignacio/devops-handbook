# Resistance to change

Because of the resistance of different teams to adjust their daily routines when their self-made isolated solutions have worked just fine, the incentives and commitment provided by upper management are important but not enough, unified processes and tool chains are needed to.

Upper management will also resist by questioning the wisdom of implementing DevOps if the concrete benefits are not visible.

Better _Cash flow_ and improved _Time to Market_ are hard to measure.

Management ask questions that address the core problems of software engineering while ignoring the symptoms.

* How can the company achieve maximal earnings in a short time period?
* How can requirements be made stable and delivered to customers quickly?

These results and visions should be measured with metrics that are shared by Development and Operations. Existing metrics can be further used or replaced by metrics that accurately express business value.
