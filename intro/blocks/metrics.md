# Measurements and Metrics

__Measuring what you are doing__ is a crucial aspect of software engineering. Sooner or later, you'll have to decide on which metrics you want to use during your software engineering process, __consider which metric is meaningful enough to aid all participants__, as well as the Development and delivery processes.

Both traditional and agile prjects often emphasize the importance of measurement because __you can only improve if you measure__.

## Traditional approach of metrics

> Traditional projects emphasize measurement as an important tool for tracking progress, identifying the current status and scheduling dates.

Often __driven by numbers__.

Classic metrics such as _static code analysis_ or _test coverage_, may continuously __draw the attention of the whole team__ without returning benefits in the same degree. It is simply too easy to fake metrics or to __adapt the process to obey the metrics instead of improving__ the process itself.

## Agile approach of metrics

> Agile projects settins try to find different approaches to create measurements, but often find themselves on dead-end streets when trying to bridge Operations to Development.

Agile development methods require a disciplined approach to ensure the customer feedback, continuous testing, and iterative development actually lead to frequent deliveries of working and valuable software.

Metrics are percived as a __onetime pointer instead of a continuous measurement__. The pointer makes the current state of the software's internal quality visible. It is then up to the team to decide what and when to adjust, or whether to do so at all.

These pointers provide indicators that there's something worth investiating, but __they don't provide the context and understanding needed to make critical decisions__.
