# Improve and Accelerate Delivery

After a release, involing a team spending a weekend in a data center deploying the past three months of work, the last thing anybody wants to do is deploy again anytime soon.

__If a task is painful, the solution is to do it more often and bring the pain forward__.

Choosing __small releases over big releases__ eventually delivers the same amount of functionality, but more functionality is delivered more quickly, and software will return value more quickly too.

__Deploying to production frequently will help keep things simple and make individual changes more focused__. The __risk of deployments is reduced__ because you practice the process of deployments.

By bring the pain forward, __you'll identify problems in your process and tool chains earlier__, and you will be able to optimize accordingly. As a result, the deployment itself will also only change in smaller batches between diferent deployments.

The process of __fixing incidents will also become optimized__, as changes between deployments are small, and in turn helps with learning about the root causes of production incidents. __Errors can be fixed faster__, and that makes a total rollback unnecesary, but even if you have to roollback, you only need to do so over a small set of changes.

It is not only a technical improvement, but also a more managable situation from a business viewpoint, to rollback a single feature than a full release with hundreds of features.
