# Improve Flow of Features

DevOps is essentially about __gaining fast feedback and decreasing risk of releases__ through a holistic approach that is meaningful for both Development and Operations.

One major step for achieving this approach is to __improve the flow of features from their inception to their availability__. This process can be refined to the point that it becomes important to __reduce batch size__ without changing capacity or demand.

> Batch size is the size of one package of changes or the amount of work that is done before a new version is shipped.

## Cycle Time

> The key point is to agree on a measurable staritng and ending point.

Period required to complete one cycle of an operation or process.

Cycle time required to process a customer order might start with the customer's phone call and end with the order being shipped.

In software engineering, cycle time describes the __amount of time required from start of development process to the beginning of the revenue generation__.

Cycle time is __only meaningful if you define 'done'__ as the point at which features have been developed, tested, and shipped to the customer, who can then begin to use them.

__If you declare victory as soon as the product ships, there is likely to be insufficient attention devoted to the residual engineering__ that must be performed to finish optimizing the product for production. __Inisisting that all of this optimization takes place before shipping the first unit is usualy a bad economic choice__, albeit a common mistake.

## Lead time

The term _Lead Time_ can be used in addition to the cycle time. It can refer to the amount of __time between an input for a request to the system and the completion of that order__. Typically, includes queuing time and work order preparation time.
