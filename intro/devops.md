# DevOps

## Definition

DevOps is a mix of patterns intended to improve collaboration between Development and Operations. It addresses shared goals and incentives, as well as processes and tools. It respects the fact that companies and projects have specific cultures and that people are more important that processes, which in turn, are more important than tools.

## Before DevOps

Development and Operations are often in conflict with each other.

Development wants to see their changes delivered to client quickly, whereas Operations are interested in stability, which means not changing the production systems too often.

As consequence, Development and Operations often _act like silos_, being two distinct teams with _suboptimal collaboration_.

## What is DevOps

DevOps means to close Development and Operations gaps by aligning and incentives and sharing approaches for processes and tools, broaden the usage of Agile practices to Operations to foster collaboration and streamline the entire software delivery process in a holistic way.

> The fundamental bases for successful DevOps are a culture of trust and a feeling of fellowship, thus DevOps centers on the concepts of _sharing_, share ideas, issues, goals, and processes, tools and goals.

Aligning existing structures and roles with DevOps is a process.

Please do not think of DevOps as a new tool for eliminating Operations staff or as a tool suite, rather it's an approach for freeing up time of the current staff to focus on harder problems that can deliver even more business value.

DevOps may __bring together subprocess to form a comprehensive delivery process that enables software to be delivered at high speed and with high quality__. However, DevOps does not necesarily introduce new tools. A specific new tool can be used to implement a given process.

DevOps __is about discipline, conventions, and a defined process that is transparent for all__.

## DevOps Activities

* __Culture__: People over processes and tools. Software is made by and for people.
* __Automation__: Essential to gain quick feedback.
* __Measurement__: Quality and shared (or at least aligned) incentives are critical.
* __Sharing__: Creates a culture where people share ideas and tools.

## What is not DevOps?

* DevOps does not allow developers to work in produciton system. It is not a "free" process that opens production-relevant aspects to developers. Instead, 

* Similary the opposite is nether true. DevOps does not mean that Operations experts take over all Development tasks.

* DevOps is not a new department. Every attempt to establish a DevOps-type department leads to bizarre constructions.
 
* DevOps is also not a new role profile that will supplant current developers and operations experts.

* Some people make the the false statement that _"DevOps is a catalog of recipes, implement them all, and you are all done"_. This is false because you will focus on finding the best solution to your individual situation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and no _"DevOps by the book"_ approach that will solve your problems.

Others will claim that _"DevOps will lose importance as Cloud solutions gain popularity, PaaS solutions will make DevOps unnecessary"_. This objection is an intersting one, but the truth is that Cloud solutions introduce another abstraction level and do not supplant Operations.

## Why DevOps ?

DevOps describes practices that streamline the software delivery process, __emphasizing the learning by streaming feedback__ from production to Development and improving the cylcle time.

DevOps will not only empower you to __deliver software more quickly__, but it will also help you produce __higher-quality software__ that is more aligned with individual requirements and basic conditions.
