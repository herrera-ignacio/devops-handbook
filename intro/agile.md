# Agile & DevOps

Agile software development has helped to bring together different project roles/expert that comprise cross-functional development teams.

Projects often go through those phases:

1. __Inception__: Project scope is defined and the business case is justified.
2. __Elaboration__: Requirements are gathered, risk factors defined, and a system architecture initialized.
3. __Construction__: Software is constructed, programmed and tested.
4. __Transition__: Software delivered to the user.
5. __Operations__: Software available to the user and maintened by Operations team.

Agile efforts often end at the transition phase from Development to Operations. The delivery of software is covered by DevOps.

DevOps provides patterns to __foster collaboration among project stakeholders and user processes__, as well as tools to streamline the software delivery process and reduce the overall cycle time.
